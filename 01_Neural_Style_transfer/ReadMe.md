# Neural Style Transfer using Pytorch



## Getting Started

The basic idea of Style Transfer is from ['Image Style Transfer using CNN'](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/html/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.html)


### Details of the experiments

The experiments are classified into five categories:

```
1. Transposed convolution to upsample images
2. Up-sampling based on interpolations
3. Changing the depth of intermediate layers
4. Altering the latent space dimension
5. Extending the DCGAN architecture
```
