# Neural Style Transfer using Pytorch



## Getting Started

The basic idea of Style Transfer is from ['Image Style Transfer using CNN'](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/html/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.html)


### Investigations on Gram matrices

The investigations are classified into four categories:

```
1. Eigen decomposition 
2. Descriptive statistics 
3. Style loss modification to reduce dimension
4. Style image patches
```
