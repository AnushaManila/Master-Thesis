# Generation of Faces with GANs-The DCGAN

The experiments on altering the intermediate layers of DCGAN network and extending the model architecture.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See acknowledgement for details on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Details of the DCGAN experiments
Original DCGAN Architecture:

The experiments are carried out to understand what happens when the parameters of DCGAN architecture are altered and are classified into four categories mentioned below:

```
1. Up-sampling based on interpolations
2. Changing the depth of intermediate layers
3. Altering the latent space dimension
4. Extending the DCGAN architecture
```
The details of the above experiments are in the section below.
