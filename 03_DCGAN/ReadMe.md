# Generation of Faces with GANs-The DCGAN

The experiments on altering the intermediate layers of DCGAN network and extending the model architecture.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See acknowledgement for details on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Details of the DCGAN experiments

The experiments are classified into five categories:

```
1. Transposed convolution to upsample images
2. Up-sampling based on interpolations
3. Changing the depth of intermediate layers
4. Altering the latent space dimension
5. Extending the DCGAN architecture
```
